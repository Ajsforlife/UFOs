# UFOs Search Engine
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to refactor the code we created to eliminate the button and add 5 text search bars where you input the results your looking for. After the searches are typed in when you hit tab or enter or just click off the search bar the results are automatically filtered to provide the filtered results in the table. There are 5 different areas of input.

### Actual Results
The following webpage has many uses. first and formost seeing all the data that we have on previous UFO sightings and being able to filter them from not just 1 search filter but 5 different search filters at once or seperately. This webpage is extremely versitile and can be used for a large variety of searches. To perform a search you would simply type in any of the search bars the criteria specified and if there is data in our file that matches thecriteria it will be shown in the table to the right. How to use the page is pretty self explanatory and can be done fairly simply. Once the criteria is entered you don't even have to hit enter you can simply click off the search bar or tab to the next one and the search results will be automatically updated!

## Summary
### Drawbacks
The main drawbacks of this webpage is the data set isn't massive enough to cover every city and every UFO sighting. So there are a lot of null results which return nothing. However the search does work for the current data we have and is easily filterable and the design is beautiful. If there was a larger set of data i think there would be less empty results.

### Recommendations
As I mentioned in the drawbacks i beleive a larger dataset would give better searching results. I also beleive if there was an ability to do partial letter searches instead of who words that match i beleive the search would have slightly better use. I also do light the button click method because then the people who are using the search know what they are supposed to do once they have theyre filters input. Overall this layout and design is very sleek and looks extremely professional.
